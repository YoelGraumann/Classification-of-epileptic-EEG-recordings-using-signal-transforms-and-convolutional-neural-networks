# Classification of Epileptic EEG Recordings Using Signal Transforms and Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains my implementation of the paper "Classification of Epileptic EEG Recordings Using Signal Transforms and Convolutional Neural Networks" by Rubén San-Segundo, Manuel Gil-Martín, Luis Fernando D'Haro-Enríquez, and José Manuel Pardo.

As the original authors did not provide publicly available code, I re-implemented their methodology in Python based on the descriptions in the paper. This project applies their approach to the original EEG dataset used in the study, and additionally explores the generalizability of the method by applying it to a music signal dataset (GZTAN).
