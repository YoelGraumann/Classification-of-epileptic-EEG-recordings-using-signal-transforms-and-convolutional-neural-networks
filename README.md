# Classification-of-epileptic-EEG-recordings-using-signal-transforms-and-convolutional-neural-networks

This is my implementation of the paper Classification of epileptic EEG recordings using signal transforms and
convolutional neural networks by Rubén San-Segundoa, Manuel Gil-Martína, Luis Fernando D'Haro-Enríqueza, José Manuel Pardoa


This I could not find their code anywhere, I implemented it myself in python.
In this project I use the code on the original dataset (EEG signals), and also on a music dataset to see if the same algorithmic structure can work on a different type of signal.
